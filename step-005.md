<picard> Make it so </picard>
=============================

So we've got some failing unit tests.
Excellent.
<ganesha> Fix it </ganesha>


Setting up for next time
========================

We'll also add in some basic views for poking around polls without using
the admin.


Oh hey there's a bug here
=========================

Unit testing doesn't catch every bug here. Our requirements said some
things about when a poll is active that isn't accounted for here. Can
you spot what it is?
This particular bug would be caught in functional testing.
